/*
Given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, 
whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
Example: Input: 4   Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; 
according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

var constructRectangle = function(area) {
    let i, w, l, minV=area-1, res=[area, 1];
    for(i=1;i<=Math.sqrt(area).toFixed(0);i++) {
        w = i;
        if(area % w === 0) {
            l = area / w;
            if(l-w < minV) {
                minV = l-w;
                res = [l, w];
            }
        }
    }
    return res; //length, width
